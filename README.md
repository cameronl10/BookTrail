## Inspiration
We''ve all been in a position where we go to the library to research and find the perfect source on the online terminal. You check the book is available and excitedly, you look for the location in the library. The given string is like: "Branch Adult Non-fiction 158 C87s6." Although the actual sorting and placement of the books are cleanly organized for the libraries, finding a book, which is the key user experience is quite irritating.

## What it does
BookTrail is a library assistant designed to elevate the experience for every single reader. Currently, our app features a solution, that allows a reader to search for a book, get an overview, and find the path directly to the shelf it's located.

## How we built it
BookTrail uses a Tailwind and Next.js front-end backed with a Node.js API. We implemented the Mappedin SDK to allow simple visualization and pathfinding within a building and developed user authentication with Auth0. To find information regarding the books, we used the Open Library + MongoDB and finally, we deployed to BookTrail.tech on vercel.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we ran into was creating a mobile-first design, as we wanted the experience to be as natural as possible for everyone visiting a library. Furthermore, we struggled a lot with the Mappedin SDK as none of us had used it before.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are excited about the pathfinding rendering that's native to mobile. We took care into developing the mobile interface and believe it turned out very user friendly.

## What's next for BookTrail
Many features are possible to be implemented with BookTrail! A room booking feature is a key thought to support universities, and creating a social element by creating suggestions and forums could help users find new reads.
